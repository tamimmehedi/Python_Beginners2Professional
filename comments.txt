As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is
often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.

For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is
doing.

A comment in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human reader â€” it is completely ignored by
the interpreter.

In Python, the # token starts a comment. The rest of the line is ignored.

Blank lines are also ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your programs much easier for
humans to parse.
