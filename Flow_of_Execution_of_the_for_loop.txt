As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is about to be executed. 
We call this the control flow, of the flow of execution of the program. When humans execute programs,
they often use their finger to point to each statement in turn. So we could think of control flow
as “Python’s moving finger”. Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement 
at a time. The for loop changes this. Control flow is often easy to visualize and understand if we 
draw a flowchart. This shows the exact steps and logic of how the for statement executes.
