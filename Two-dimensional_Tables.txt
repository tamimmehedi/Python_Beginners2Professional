A two-dimensional table is a table where you read the value at the intersection of a row and a column. A multiplication
table is a good example. Let’s say you want to print a multiplication table for the values from 1 to 6.
A good way to start is to write a loop that prints the multiples of 2, all on one line:

  for i in range(1, 7):
    print(2 * i, end="  ")
  print()

Here we’ve used the range function, but made it start its sequence at 1. As the loop executes, the value of i changes
from 1 to 6. When all the elements of the range have been assigned to i, the loop terminates. Each time through the
loop, it displays the value of 2 * i, followed by three spaces.

Again, the extra end=" " argument in the print function suppresses the newline, and uses three spaces instead.
After the loop completes, the call to print at line 3 finishes the current line, and starts a new line.
