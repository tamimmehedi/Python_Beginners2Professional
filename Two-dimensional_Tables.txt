A two-dimensional table is a table where you read the value at the intersection of a row and a column. A multiplication
table is a good example. Letâ€™s say you want to print a multiplication table for the values from 1 to 6.
A good way to start is to write a loop that prints the multiples of 2, all on one line:

  for i in range(1, 7):
    print(2 * i, end="  ")
  print()
