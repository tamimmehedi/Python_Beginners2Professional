The >>> is called the Python prompt. The interpreter uses the prompt to indicate that it is ready for instructions. We
typed 2 + 2, and the interpreter evaluated our expression, and replied 4, and on the next line it gave a new prompt,
indicating that it is ready for more input.

Alternatively, you can write a program in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file. Such a file is
called a script. Scripts have the advantage that they can be saved to disk, printed, and so on.
Working directly in the interpreter is convenient for testing short bits of code because you get immediate feedback.
Think of it as scratch paper used to help you work out problems. Anything longer than a few lines should be put into
a script.
