Each of the six relational operators has a logical opposite: for example, suppose we can get a driving licence 
when our age is greater or equal to 18, we can not get the driving licence when we are less than 18.
Notice that the opposite of >= is <.

operator:

    ==    !=    <    <=    >    >=
    
logical opposite:

    !=    ==    >=    >    <=    <

Understanding these logical opposites allows us to sometimes get rid of not operators. not operators are often quite
difficult to read in computer code, and our intentions will usually be clearer if we can eliminate them.
For example, if we wrote this Python:

if not (age >= 18):
    print("Hey, you're too young to get a driving licence!")

it would probably be clearer to use the simplification laws, and to write instead:

if age < 18:
    print("Hey, you're too young to get a driving licence!")
    
Two powerful simplification laws (called de Morgan’s laws) that are often helpful when dealing with complicated
Boolean expressions are:

(not (x and y)) == ((not x) or (not y))
(not (x or y))  == ((not x) and (not y))

For example, suppose we can slay the dragon only if our magic lightsabre sword is charged to 90% or higher, and we
have 100 or more energy units in our protective shield. We find this fragment of Python code in the game:

if not (sword_charge >= 0.90 and shield_energy >= 100):
    print("Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!")
else:
    print("The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the gorgeous princess!")

de Morgan’s laws together with the logical opposites would let us rework the condition in a (perhaps) easier to under-
stand way like this:

if sword_charge < 0.90 or shield_energy < 100:
    print("Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!")
else:
    print("The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the gorgeous princess!")
    
We could also get rid of the not by swapping around the then and else parts of the conditional. So here is a third
version, also equivalent:

if sword_charge >= 0.90 and shield_energy >= 100:
    print("The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the gorgeous princess!")
else:
    print("Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!")
