To draw a square we’d like to do the same thing four times — move the turtle, and turn. We previously used 8 lines to
have alex draw the four sides of a square. This does exactly the same, but using just three lines:

  for i in [0,1,2,3]:
  alex.forward(50)
  alex.left(90)
  
Some observations:
• While “saving some lines of code” might be convenient, it is not the big deal here. What is much more important
is that we’ve found a “repeating pattern” of statements, and reorganized our program to repeat the pattern. Find-
ing the chunks and somehow getting our programs arranged around those chunks is a vital skill in computational
thinking.
• The values [0,1,2,3] were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times. We could have used any four values,
but these are the conventional ones to use. In fact, they are so popular that Python gives us special built-in
range objects:

for i in range(4):   #Executes the body with i = 0, then 1, then 2, then 3

for x in range(10):  #Sets x to each of ... [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
