A Boolean value is either true or false. It is named after the British mathematician, George Boole, who first formulated
Boolean algebra â€” some rules for reasoning about and combining these values. This is the basis of all modern
computer logic.
In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False (the capitalization must be exactly as shown), and the Python
type is bool.
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
>>> type(true)

A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value. For example, the
operator == tests if two values are equal. It produces (or yields) a Boolean value:
