There is a built-in function in Python for getting input from the user:

name = input("Please enter your name: ")

The user of the program can enter the name and click OK, and when this happens the text that has been entered is
returned from the input function, and in this case assigned to the variable name.

Even if you asked the user to enter their age, you would get back a string like "17". It would be your job, as the
programmer, to convert that string into a int or a float, using the int or float converter functions we saw earlier.
