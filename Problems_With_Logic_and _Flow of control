We often want to know if some condition holds for any item in a list, e.g. “does the list have any odd numbers?” This
is a common mistake:

    # Buggy version
    for number in numbers:
      if number % 2 == 1:
        print(True)
        break
      else:
      
    print(False)
    break
    
Can we spot two problems here? As soon as we execute a break, we’ll leave the loop. So the logic of saying “If I
find an odd number I can return True” is fine. However, we cannot return False after only looking at one item —
we can only return False if we’ve been through all the items, and none of them are odd. So line 10 should not be
there, and lines 8 and 9 have to be outside the loop. Here is a corrected version:

    numbers = [10, 5, 24, 8, 6]
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 1:
        print(True)
        break
    else:
        print(False)
