There are many modules in Python that provide very powerful features that we can use in our own programs. Some of
these can send email, or fetch web pages. The one weâ€™ll look at in this chapter allows us to create turtles and get them
to draw shapes and patterns.
The turtles are fun, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves a little more Python, and to develop
our theme of computational thinking, or thinking like a computer scientist. Most of the Python covered here will be
explored in more depth later.
