Another form of the if statement is one in which the else clause is omitted entirely. In this case, when the condition
evaluates to True, the statements are executed, otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the
if.

if x < 0:
  print("The negative number ", x, " is not valid here.")
  x = 42
  print("I've decided to use the number 42 instead.")
print("The square root of ", x, "is", math.sqrt(x))

In this case, the print function that outputs the square root is the one after the if â€” not because we left a blank line,
but because of the way the code is indented. Note too that the function call math.sqrt(x) will give an error unless we 
have an import math statement, usually placed near the top of our script.
