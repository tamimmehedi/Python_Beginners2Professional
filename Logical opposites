Each of the six relational operators has a logical opposite: for example, suppose we can get a driving licence 
when our age is greater or equal to 18, we can not get the driving licence when we are less than 18.
Notice that the opposite of >= is <.

operator:

    ==
    !=
    <
    <=
    >
    >=
    
logical opposite:

    !=
    ==
    >=
    >
    <=
    <

Understanding these logical opposites allows us to sometimes get rid of not operators. not operators are often quite
difficult to read in computer code, and our intentions will usually be clearer if we can eliminate them.
For example, if we wrote this Python:

if not (age >= 18):
    print("Hey, you're too young to get a driving licence!")
