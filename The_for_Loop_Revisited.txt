Recall that the for loop processes each item in a list. Each item in turn is (re-)assigned to the loop variable,
and the body of the loop is executed. We saw this example before:

  for friend in ["Joe", "Zoe", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
  invite = "Hi " + friend + ". Please come to my party!"
  print(invite)

Running through all the items in a list is called traversing the list, or traversal.
Let us write some code now to sum up all the elements in a list of numbers. Do this by hand first, and try to isolate
exactly what steps you take. You’ll find you need to keep some “running total” of the sum so far, either on a piece of
paper, in your head, or in your calculator. Remembering things from one step to the next is precisely why we have
variables in a program: so we’ll need some variable to remember the “running total”. It should be initialized with a
value of zero, and then we need to traverse the items in the list. For each item, we’ll want to update the running total
by adding the next number to it.

  numbers = [5, 6, 32, 21, 9]
  running_total = 0
  for number in numbers:
  running_total = running_total + number
  print(running_total)
