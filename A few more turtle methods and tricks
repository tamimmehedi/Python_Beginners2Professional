Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances. So tess.forward(-100) will move tess backwards, and
tess.left(-30) turns her to the right. Additionally, because there are 360 degrees in a circle, turning 30 to the
left will get tess facing in the same direction as turning 330 to the right! (The on-screen animation will differ, though
— you will be able to tell if tess is turning clockwise or counter-clockwise!)
This suggests that we don’t need both a left and a right turn method — we could be minimalists, and just have one
method. There is also a backward method. (If you are very nerdy, you might enjoy saying alex.backward(-100)
to move alex forward!)
Part of thinking like a scientist is to understand more of the structure and rich relationships in our field. So revising a
few basic facts about geometry and number lines, and spotting the relationships between left, right, backward, forward,
negative and positive distances or angles values is a good start if we’re going to play with turtles.
A turtle’s pen can be picked up or put down. This allows us to move a turtle to a different place without drawing a
line.
The methods are:
  alex.penup()
  alex.forward(100)
  alex.pendown() 
Every turtle can have its own shape.The ones available “out of the box” are arrow, blank, circle, classic,
square, triangle, turtle.
alex.shape("turtle")
