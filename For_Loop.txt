When we drew the square, it was quite tedious. We had to explicitly repeat the steps of moving and turning four times.
If we were drawing a hexagon, or an octogon, or a polygon with 42 sides, it would have been worse.
So a basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some code, over and over again.
Python’s for loop solves this for us. Let’s say we have some friends, and we’d like to send them each an email inviting
them to our party. We don’t quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we’ll just print a message for each
friend:

for friend in ["Joe", "Zoe", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
invite = "Hi " + friend + ". Please come to my party!"
print(invite)
# more code can follow here ...

When we run this, the output looks like this:

Hi Joe. Please come to my party!
Hi Zoe. Please come to my party!
Hi Zuki. Please come to my party!
Hi Thandi. Please come to my party!
Hi Paris. Please come to my party!
