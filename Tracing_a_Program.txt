To write effective computer programs, and to build a good conceptual model of program execution, a programmer
needs to develop the ability to trace the execution of a computer program. Tracing involves becoming the computer
and following the flow of execution through a sample program run, recording the state of all variables and any output
the program generates after each instruction is executed.

To understand this process, let’s trace the call to the collatz code above with n = 3 from the previous section. At the
start of the trace, we have a variable, n, with an initial value of 3. Since 3 is not equal to 1, the while loop body is
executed. 3 is printed and 3 % 2 == 0 is evaluated. Since it evaluates to False, the else branch is executed and
3 * 3 + 1 is evaluated and assigned to n.

To keep track of all this as you hand trace a program, make a column heading on a piece of paper for each variable
created as the program runs and another one for output. Our trace so far would look something like this:

    n   output printed so far
    3  3,
    10

Since 10 != 1 evaluates to True, the loop body is again executed, and 10 is printed. 10 % 2 == 0 is true, so the
if branch is executed and n becomes 5. By the end of the trace we have:

n     output printed so far

3     3,
10    3, 10,
5     3, 10, 5,
16    3, 10, 5, 16,
8     3, 10, 5, 16, 8,
4     3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4,
2     3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,
1     3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Tracing can be a bit tedious and error prone (that’s why we get computers to do this stuff in the first place!), but it is
an essential skill for a programmer to have. From this trace we can learn a lot about the way our code works. We can
observe that as soon as n becomes a power of 2, for example, the program will require log 2 (n) executions of the loop
body to complete. We can also see that the final 1 will not be printed as output within the body of the loop, which is
why we put the special print function at the end.
