Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a compu-
tation like that is a chained conditional:

if x < y:
  <STATEMENTS_A>
elif x > y:
  <STATEMENTS_B>
else:     # x == y   
  <STATEMENTS_C>
  
elif is an abbreviation of else if. Again, exactly one branch will be executed. There is no limit of the number of
elif statements but only a single (and optional) final else statement is allowed and it must be the last branch
in the statement:

if choice == "a":
  function_one()
elif choice == "b":
  function_two()
elif choice == "c":
  function_three()
else:
  print("Invalid choice.")
