As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is about to be executed. We call this the
control flow, of the flow of execution of the program. When humans execute programs, they often use their finger to
point to each statement in turn. So we could think of control flow as “Python’s moving finger”.
Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement at a time. The for loop changes this.
