Now we’ll come up with an even more adventurous list of structured data. In this case, we have a list of students. Each
student has a name which is paired up with another list of subjects that they are enrolled for:

    students = [
    ("John", ["CompSci", "Physics"]),
    ("Vusi", ["Maths", "CompSci", "Stats"]),
    ("Jess", ["CompSci", "Accounting", "Economics", "Management"]),
    ("Sarah", ["InfSys", "Accounting", "Economics", "CommLaw"]),
    ("Zuki", ["Sociology", "Economics", "Law", "Stats", "Music"])]
    
Here we’ve assigned a list of five elements to the variable students. Let’s print out each student name, and the
number of subjects they are enrolled for:

        # Print all students with a count of their courses.
        for name, subjects in students:
        print(name, "takes", len(subjects), "courses")

Python agreeably responds with the following output:

    John takes 2 courses
    Vusi takes 3 courses
    Jess takes 4 courses
    Sarah takes 4 courses
    Zuki takes 5 courses

Now we’d like to ask how many students are taking CompSci. This needs a counter, and for each student we need a
second loop that tests each of the subjects in turn:

    # Count how many students are taking CompSci
    counter = 0
    for name, subjects in students:
    for s in subjects:
    # A nested loop!
    if s == "CompSci":
    counter += 1
    print("The number of students taking CompSci is", counter)
    
    The number of students taking CompSci is 3.

A more concise of doing this would be the following:
    counter = 0
    for name, subjects in students:
    if "CompSci" in subjects:
    counter += 1
    
You should set up a list of your own data that interests you — perhaps a list of your CDs, each containing a list of
song titles on the CD, or a list of movie titles, each with a list of movie stars who acted in the movie. You could then
ask questions like “Which movies starred Angelina Jolie?”
