Recall that the for loop processes each item in a list. Each item in turn is (re-)assigned to the loop variable,
and the body of the loop is executed. We saw this example before:

  for friend in ["Joe", "Zoe", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
  invite = "Hi " + friend + ". Please come to my party!"
  print(invite)
