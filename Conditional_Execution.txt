In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of
the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this ability. The simplest form is the if statement:

if x % 2 == 0:
  print(x, "is even.")
  print("Did you know that 2 is the only even number that is prime?")
  
else:
  print(x, "is odd.")
  print("Did you know that multiplying two odd numbers " + you know that multiplying two odd numbers " + "always gives an odd     result?")
