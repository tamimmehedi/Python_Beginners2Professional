The following snippet counts the number of decimal digits in a positive integer:

  n = 3029
  count = 0
  while n != 0:
  count = count + 1
  n = n // 10
  print(count)

Trace the execution to convince yourself that it works.

This snippet demonstrates an important pattern of computation called a counter. The variable count is initialized to
0 and then incremented each time the loop body is executed. When the loop exits, count contains the result â€” the
total number of times the loop body was executed, which is the same as the number of digits.

If we wanted to only count digits that are either 0 or 5, adding a conditional before incrementing the counter will do
the trick:
