Let’s look at a simple sequence that has fascinated and foxed mathematicians for many years. They still cannot answer
even quite simple questions about this.

The “computational rule” for creating the sequence is to start from some given n, and to generate the next term of
the sequence from n, either by halving n, (whenever n is even), or else by multiplying it by three and adding 1. The
sequence terminates when n reaches 1.

This Python snippet captures that algorithm:

  n = 1027371
  while n != 1:
  print(n, end=", ")
  if n % 2 == 0:
  n = n // 2
  else:
  n = n * 3 + 1
  print(n, end=".\n")
