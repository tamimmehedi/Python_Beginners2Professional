Letâ€™s write a couple of lines of Python program to create a new turtle and start drawing a rectangle.
 
import turtle             # Allows us to use turtles
window = turtle.Screen()  # Creates a playground for turtles
alex = turtle.Turtle()    # Creates a playground for turtles

alex.forward(50)          # Tell alex to turn by 90 degrees
alex.left(90)             # Complete the second side of a rectangle
alex.forward(30)          # Tell alex to move forward by 50 units
window.mainloop()         # Wait for user to close window
