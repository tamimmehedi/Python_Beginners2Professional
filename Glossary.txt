assignment statement A statement that assigns a value to a name (variable). To the left of the assignment operator,
=, is a name. To the right of the assignment token is an expression which is evaluated by the Python interpreter
and then assigned to the name. The difference between the left and right hand sides of the assignment statement
is often confusing to new programmers. In the following assignment:
number = number + 1
number plays a very different role on each side of the =. On the right it is a value and makes up part of the
expression which will be evaluated by the Python interpreter before assigning it to the name on the left.
assignment token = is Pythonâ€™s assignment token. Do not confuse it with equals, which is an operator for comparing
values.
composition The ability to combine simple expressions and statements into compound statements and expressions in
order to represent complex computations concisely.
concatenate To join two strings end-to-end.
data type A set of values. The type of a value determines how it can be used in expressions. So far, the types you
have seen are integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and strings (str).
evaluate To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to yield a single value.
