The break statement is used to immediately leave the body of its loop. The next statement to be executed is the first
one after the body:

  for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29]:
        if i % 2 == 1:   # If the number is odd
            break         # ... immediately exit the loop
        print(i)
  print("done")

This prints:
  12
  16
  done

The pre-test loop — standard loop behaviour

for and while loops do their tests at the start, before executing any part of the body. They’re called pre-test loops,
because the test happens before (pre) the body. break and return (discussed later) are our tools for adapting this
standard behaviour.
