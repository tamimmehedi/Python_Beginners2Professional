When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence.
Python follows the same precedence rules for its mathematical operators that mathematics does. The acronym PEM-
DAS is a useful way to remember the order of operations:
1. Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you
want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, 2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You
can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even though it
doesnâ€™t change the result.
