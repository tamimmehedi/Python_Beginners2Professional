As we have mentioned previously, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same variable. A new assignment
makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value).

    airtime_remaining = 15
    print(airtime_remaining)
    airtime_remaining = 7
    print(airtime_remaining)
    
 The output of this program is:
    15
    7
