Here is a fragment of code that demonstrates the use of the while statement:

  n = 6
  current_sum = 0
  i = 0
  while i <= n:
    current_sum += i
    i += 1
  print(current_sum)

You can almost read the while statement as if it were English. It means, while i is less than or equal to n, continue
executing the body of the loop. Within the body, each time, increment i. When i passes n, return your accumulated
sum. In other words: while <CONDITION> is True, <STATEMENT> is executed. Of course, this example could be
written more concisely as sum(range(n + 1)) because the function sum already exists.

More formally, here is precise flow of execution for a while statement:
• Evaluate the condition at line 5, yielding a value which is either False or True.
• If the value is False, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement (line 8 in this
case).
• If the value is True, execute each of the statements in the body (lines 6 and 7) and then go back to the while
statement at line 5.

The body consists of all of the statements indented below the while keyword.
Notice that if the loop condition is False the first time we get loop, the statements in the body of the loop are never
executed.

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false
and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an infinite loop.

In the case here, we can prove that the loop terminates because we know that the value of n is finite, and we can see
that the value of i increments each time through the loop, so eventually it will have to exceed n. In other cases it is
not so easy, maybe even impossible, to tell if the loop will ever terminate.

What you will notice here is that the while loop is more work for you — the programmer — than the equivalent
for loop. When using a while loop one has to manage the loop variable yourself: give it an initial value, test for
completion, and then make sure you change something in the body so that the loop terminates. By comparison, here
is an equivalent snippet that uses for instead:

    n = 6
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(n+1):
    current_sum += i
    print(current_sum)
